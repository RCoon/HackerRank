uniq

# Given a text file, count the number of times each line repeats itself. 
# Only consider consecutive repetitions. Display the space separated count
# and line, respectively. There shouldn't be any leading or trailing spaces. 
# Please note that the uniq -c command by itself will generate the output in
# a different format than the one expected here.
