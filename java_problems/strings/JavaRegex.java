/*
 * Write a class called myRegex which will contain a string pattern. You need
 * to write a regular expression and assign it to the pattern such that it 
 * can be used to validate an IP address. Use the following definition of an IP
 * address:
 * 
 * IP address is a string in the form "A.B.C.D", where the value of A, B, C,
 * and D may range from 0 to 255. Leading zeros are allowed. The length of
 * A, B, C, or D can't be greater than 3.
 * 
 * Sample Input:
 * 
 * 000.12.12.034
 * 121.234.12.12
 * 23.45.12.56
 * 00.12.123.123123.123
 * 122.23
 * Hello.IP
